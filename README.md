# RoboType-II

Mobile text entry research is contingent on user-based evaluations, which are frequently carried out in small-scale lab experiments. Recruitment and execution of experiments are costly in terms of time and effort required. Further, the results are hard to generalise, because of the small number of participants in the experiments. Studies are sometimes replicable, but not reproducible. 

RoboType-II is a realistic open-source simulator for mobile text entry, written in Python and based on the consolidation of state-of-the-art understanding of human behaviour during entry tasks. 

It aims to aid researchers to produce fast and accurate evaluations of mobile text entry ideas with fully reproducible results. It can be used to significantly reduce time required to explore the design space of new prototypes on various user bases, or as a benchmark to compare results with other researchers.

This implementation is an extension of our previous work (see https://github.com/komis1/RoboType)

## Changes

Major changes in this implementation include a totally new cognitive architecture implementation, inspired by Miller's TOTE theory and Norman's Action Cycle. Further, the keyboard implementations now support use of word suggestion areas (see examples in the code).
